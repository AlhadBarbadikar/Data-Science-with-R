# Data-Science-with-R
This repository is to store some of my experiments in DS using R. 

## Visualization
- [Example 1](https://github.com/tz33cu/Data-Science-with-R/blob/master/Visualization/Example%201/Animated.Rmd): animated plot using the R animation package (saveGIF).
- [Example 2](https://github.com/tz33cu/Data-Science-with-R/blob/master/Visualization/Example%202/circlize.Rmd): circulized visualization using the R circlize package.
