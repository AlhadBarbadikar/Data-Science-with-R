# Data-Science-with-R
This repository is to store some of my experiments in DS using R. 

## Tutorials
- Tutorial 0: Get started with R by completing [Try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) from Code School. 
- Tutorial 1: [Introduction to R](Tutorials/Tutorial_introR.nb.html). ([R notebook](Tutorials/Tutorial_introR.Rmd)).
- Tutoral 1b: [Exploring MLB salaries](Tutorials/Tutorial1b_baseball.nb.html). ([R notebook](Tutorials/Tutorial1b_baseball.Rmd)).


## Visualization
- [Example 1](https://github.com/tz33cu/Data-Science-with-R/blob/master/Visualization/Example%201/Animated.Rmd): animated plot using the R *animation* package (saveGIF).
- [Example 2](https://github.com/tz33cu/Data-Science-with-R/blob/master/Visualization/Example%202/circlize.Rmd): circulized visualization using the R *circlize* package. 
- [Example 3](https://github.com/tz33cu/Data-Science-with-R/blob/master/Visualization/Example%203/minard.Rmd): Re-vision Minard's plot using *Rgooglemaps*.
